# Graph Testing (Game)
## Uses pygame, not intended for commercial or practical (=no production) use

I made this only for learning about the Graph Theory and stuff like that - so a bit "Research" for my self and testing if I understood it.

# TODO
Currently no Algorithms for finding MST or something like that implemented, this will come soon.
